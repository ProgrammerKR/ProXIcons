## Request a New Icon

Have an idea for a new icon? We'd love to hear from you!

You can request a new icon by opening an issue using our icon request template:

[Request a New Icon](https://github.com/ProgrammerKR/ProXIcons/issues/new?assignees=&labels=icon+request&template=icon_request.yml&title=%5BIcon+Request%5D+Add+your-icon-name)

### What to Include in Your Request:

- **Icon Name**: A clear and descriptive name (e.g., `github-logo`)
- **Description**: What the icon represents or where it would be useful
- **Category**: (Optional) UI, Media, Social, Business, etc.
- **Reference**: (Optional) A sample image or link for design inspiration

We review all icon requests carefully and include the most useful ones in future releases!

> Tip: Check if the icon already exists before submitting a request!
